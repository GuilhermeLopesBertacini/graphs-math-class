# Social Network Analysis - Unimar Math Project

This project was developed as part of a math class at Unimar University. It performs a social network analysis based on a dataset of people and their relationships with celebrities.

## Project Overview

The code performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Loads a dataset containing information about people and the celebrities they follow.
2. **Data Transformation:** Converts the data into a suitable format for analysis.
3. **Matrix Generation:** Generates three matrices:
    - Incidence Matrix: Represents the relationships between people and celebrities.
    - Similarity Matrix: Calculates the similarity between people based on their shared celebrity preferences.
    - Co-occurrence Matrix: Shows how often celebrities are mentioned together by people.
4. **Graph Construction and Visualization:** Creates and visualizes three graphs:
    - Incidence Graph: Shows the connections between people and celebrities.
    - Similarity Graph: Illustrates the similarities between people.
    - Co-occurrence Graph: Depicts the relationships between celebrities based on their co-occurrence.

## Libraries Used

The project uses the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- networkx
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Upload the `corpus.txt` file to your Google Colab environment.
2. Run the code cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.
3. The generated graphs will be displayed inline in the notebook.
